# React Native: Uninitialized State Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This often happens during the component mounting phase, before the state has had a chance to be populated.

## The Problem

The `UninitializedState.js` file shows an incorrect approach where we try to directly use a state variable before it has been assigned a value.  This leads to undefined behavior and potential errors.

## The Solution

The `UninitializedStateSolution.js` file presents the correct solution.  We use the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array to ensure the calculation that depends on the state is performed after the state has been initialized during the mounting process.  Alternatively, conditional rendering can prevent errors by checking if the state is initialized before trying to use it.
