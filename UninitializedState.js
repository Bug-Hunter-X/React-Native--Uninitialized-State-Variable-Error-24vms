This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized.  This commonly happens during component mounting, before the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array has run or in asynchronous operations.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const doubledCount = count * 2; // Error: count might be undefined initially

  return <Text>Doubled count: {doubledCount}</Text>;
}

// Correct:
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [doubledCount, setDoubledCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setDoubledCount(count * 2);
  }, [count]);

  return <Text>Doubled count: {doubledCount}</Text>;
}
```
